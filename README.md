### Page listing all locations
On this page users can see all locations available with information about their average raiting and how many times they were visited. They can be filterred by name, category and in which region they are located.
Below every location there are two buttons. One marks the location as visited for the current user, and the other adds the location to the user's wish to visit list.
If the location was marked as visited by the user a button for createing a post shows up and the location is removed from the user's wishlist.
